    "my_door_choice is set to 1, meaning you initially always choose door 1.\n",
    "i_won is a counter that will track how many times you win.\n",
    "reps defines the number of iterations or repetitions of the game (1,000,000 in this case) to run simulations.\n",

    "A for loop runs the simulation reps times (1,000,000 repetitions), simulating the Monty Hall problem repeatedly.\n",

    "4. Choosing the Winning Door\n",
    "\n",
    "secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)\n",
    "This line randomly selects the \"secret\" winning door for the current round using np.random.choice(). It selects one door from the tuple all_door_options (1, 2, or 3).\n",

    "The code you've shared is part of a basic implementation of a Markov chain-based chatbot. Here's an explanation of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Markov Chain: A Markov chain is a stochastic process where the future state depends only on the present state, not the sequence of events that preceded it. For a chatbot, this means predicting the next word based on the current word.\n",
    "Markovian Chatbot: This chatbot generates text by predicting the next word in a sentence based on previous words, using probabilities learned from some input text.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Breakdown of the Code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used: A dictionary (or defaultdict) that keeps track of how many times each word has been used in the text.\n",
    "next_word: A dictionary of dictionaries (or nested defaultdicts) that keeps track of the next word that follows each word and how often that happens.\n",
    "Iteration Through Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-1]):\n",
    "This line loops over each word in the words list, except the last one (words[:-1]). The goal is to capture the word pairings, where each word is followed by the next one.\n",
    "Tracking Word Occurrences:\n",
    "\n",
    "if word in word_used:\n",
    "The code checks if the current word (word) is already in the word_used dictionary.\n",
    "First Encounter of a Word:\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    word_used[word] = 1\n",
    "    next_word[word] = {}\n",
    "If the word is not in the word_used dictionary, it initializes it with a count of 1. It also initializes an empty dictionary for this word in next_word to track the words that can follow it.\n",
    "Tracking the Next Word:\n",
    "\n",
    "if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:\n",
    "    next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1\n",
    "Here, the code checks if the next word (words[i+1]) is already a recorded possible follower of the current word in the next_word dictionary.\n",
    "If it is, it increments the count of how often this pair occurs.\n",
    "If not, it adds the next word to the dictionary and initializes its count to 1.\n",
    "Incrementing Word Occurrence Count:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used[word] += 1\n",
    "After processing the next word, the code increments the occurrence count for the current word.\n",
    "How This Leads to a Markov Chain:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Training: As the code processes a body of text, it builds a frequency-based model of word transitions, recording how often each word appears and what words are likely to follow it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Prediction: After building the model, you can generate text by starting with a random word and using the next_word dictionary to probabilistically choose the next word based on the observed frequencies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Missing Parts:\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are some issues with the code:\n",
    "The line if word in word_used: is incomplete—it doesn’t have an action for when the condition is true.\n",
    "This structure would need a way to generate text by selecting the next word based on the learned probabilities from next_word."

    "Summary (4): In this session, we discussed a basic implementation of a Markov chain-based chatbot. The code provided creates two main dictionaries: word_used, which tracks the frequency of each word, and next_word, which records how often each word is followed by other words. The code iterates through a list of words, checking if each word has been encountered before and updating the dictionaries accordingly. This establishes a probabilistic model of word transitions, which can later be used to generate text by predicting the next word based on observed frequencies. We also noted some incomplete elements in the code that need to be addressed for full functionality. If desired, I can assist in correcting and completing the code for a fully operational Markovian chatbot.\n",

    "# When prompted with the first extension: \n",
    "\n",
    "This extension of the Markovian chatbot enhances its capabilities by considering pairs of words (bigrams) instead of single words. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Changes:\n",
    "New Dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2: A defaultdict that counts occurrences of word pairs (bigrams) instead of individual words.\n",
    "next_word2: A nested defaultdict that tracks how often each word follows a specific word pair.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Iteration Over Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "The loop iterates through the words list, but stops two words before the end to allow for the bigram construction.\n",
    "Building Bigrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2[word + ' ' + words[i + 1]] += 1\n",
    "This line creates a bigram by combining the current word (word) with the next word (words[i + 1]) and increments its count in word_used2.\n",
    "Tracking Next Words for Bigrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "next_word2[word + ' ' + words[i + 1]][words[i + 2]] += 1\n",
    "This updates next_word2 to record how often the word at position i + 2 follows the bigram formed by word and words[i + 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications:\n",
    "This approach allows the chatbot to generate text based on pairs of words, potentially leading to more coherent and contextually appropriate responses than using single words alone.\n",
    "By considering the relationship between two consecutive words, the chatbot can better capture the flow of language and produce more natural-sounding sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When prompted with the second extension: \n",
    "\n",
    "This second extension of the Markovian chatbot introduces a character-based context, enhancing the model's ability to generate dialogue or text specific to different characters from a dataset. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "Character Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Counter creates a frequency dictionary from the character column of the avatar dataset, formatting the names by making them uppercase and replacing spaces with dots. This allows for consistent key handling when tracking dialogue.\n",
    "Nested Dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested dictionary structure is created using defaultdict, allowing for a hierarchy of data organized first by character and then by word pairs.\n",
    "Looping Through Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "Similar to the previous extensions, this loop processes the words list but stops two words before the end.\n",
    "Character Context Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if word in characters:\n",
    "    character = word\n",
    "If the current word matches a character name, it assigns that character to the character variable, setting the context for subsequent word pairs.\n",
    "Building Word Pair Counts for Characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code checks if the current character is already in the word_used2C dictionary. If not, it initializes an entry for that character.\n",
    "It then constructs the bigram (word + ' ' + words[i + 1]) and increments its count for that character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking Next Words for Character-Specific Bigrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also checks and initializes entries in the next_word2C dictionary, which tracks how often each word follows a specific bigram for a given character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implications:\n",
    "This extension allows the chatbot to differentiate responses based on character context, making it more suitable for role-playing or storytelling applications where different characters may have distinct speech patterns.\n",
    "By building character-specific models, the chatbot can generate text that reflects the unique traits or dialogue styles of each character."

    "Summary: In this session, two extensions to a Markovian chatbot were discussed. The first extension enhances the chatbot by incorporating bigrams (pairs of words) instead of individual words, improving its ability to generate more contextually appropriate text. This extension uses word_used2 and next_word2 dictionaries to track the frequency of bigrams and the words that follow them. The second extension adds a character-based context to the chatbot. It utilizes a dataset to identify character names, and then builds a nested dictionary structure (word_used2C and next_word2C) to track word pairs and subsequent words specific to each character. This allows the chatbot to generate text tailored to different characters, making it more suitable for scenarios involving distinct character dialogue.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, we discussed your Markovian chatbot code and its extension. The original code sets up a basic Markov chain model that tracks word sequences and their transitions. The extension introduces a character-specific Markov chain approach, where sequences are managed separately for each character. It uses bigrams—pairs of consecutive words—rather than just single-word dependencies, to capture more context and improve the chatbot’s responses. By processing the character data and structuring word sequences and transitions in a hierarchical manner, the extension aims to create more personalized and contextually relevant interactions.\n",

    "Regarding ChatGPT and my conversations with it, I can say that its helpful almost all of the time, where it correctly answers all of my questions and even provides valid explanations for what I am asking. Only in some rare instances, it is limiting, such as prompting it to provide a working code that does not work (which is what happened for my first statistics homework assignment), but the issue is usually resolved after I prompt it to redo the code and provide a working version once or twice. Whenever ChatGPT provides information that is too \"high-level\" for me to understand, I ask it to explain it in a more simplier manner, or to just summarize what is has provided for me, and in the opposite instance where I feel like there is more explanation that is needed, I ask it to expand on a certain point that I want more context for. So in regards to an expert in the field of study that understand the ins and outs of the industry and career path in question (which is machine learning), I will ask chatGPT more specific questions, prompt it for more detailed explanations, and ask it to provide me with some reccomendations that I can perform myself (such as learning about a topic).
